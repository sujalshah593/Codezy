<h2 class="flex justify-center items-center text-2xl">ðŸ“º Codezy â€“ Tech Video Platform</h2>
Codezy is a modern and responsive tech video platform inspired by YouTube, designed to host and organize technology-related tutorial videos. Built entirely with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, this project is part of my learning journey and showcases my front-end development capabilities.

ðŸŽ¯ This is a frontend-only project â€” no backend or APIs are used. All content is locally managed.
